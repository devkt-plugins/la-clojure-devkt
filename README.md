# Clojure plugin for DevKt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/devkt-plugins/la-clojure-devkt.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/devkt-plugins/la-clojure-devkt)

This is yet another clojure plugin for [DevKt](https://github.com/ice1000/dev-kt),
based on [la-clojure](https://github.com/JetBrains/la-clojure).

It works better than [this plugin](https://github.com/devkt-plugins/clojure-devkt).

Everything related to DevKt are in [this Java file](src/org/jetbrains/plugin/devkt/clojure/Clojure.java).  
You may use it as a reference of DevKt plugin development, if you don't know Kotlin.
